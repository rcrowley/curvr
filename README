NAME
	curvr -- Automatic approximation of typical Photoshop actions

SYNOPSIS
	curvr <input> [<process> [<param>...]] <output>
	curvall <directory> [<process>]
	curvrmail

DESCRIPTION
	Editing images is a painful and repetitive process.  The good hacker
	automates things like this.  Aaron's filtr script doesn't quite do
	what I want and neither does the GraphicsMagick command line tool.
	This tool does automatic and acceptable approximations of the curves
	tool I use most often in Photoshop.

	The supporting scripts and config files enable the phone -> server
	-> Flickr workflow.

ACTIONS
	curve (default)
		First normalizes the image by tucking white and black points,
		then applies a color map keeping whites and blacks consistent
		while darkening the mid-range.  Approximates a slightly
		downward curve in the Photoshop Curves palette.
	bigcurve
		Bigger.  60% bigger even.
	anticurve
		Opposite of curve, boosting mid-range instead of darkening it.

DEPENDENCIES
	GraphicsMagick
		Developed using GraphicsMagick 1.1.10 on Linux.  Will likely
		work with 1.1.x and on other platforms, but I don't care to try.
	Flickr::Upload::FireEagle
		For uploading and automatic geotagging.  See the small patch that
		prevents the FireEagle staleness check for localities.
	XML::Simple
	Digest::MD5
	Mime::Base64
